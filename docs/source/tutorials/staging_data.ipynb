    "# Staging Data\n",
    "\n",
    "RADICAL-Pilot (RP) provides capabilities of moving data from its client side to its agent side (on the HPC platform) and back, and within the agent space, i.e., between sandboxes for session, pilots and tasks. To ensure that a task finds the data it needs on the HPC platform where it runs, RP provides a mechanism to stage the task's input data before its execution. Further, RP allows users to stage the output data generated by tasks, back to their workstations or in any other file system location on the HPC platform. Users can then collect their data from that location after their RP application has terminated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of the tutorial shows how the user can describe data staging and what that means for the running application.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n",
    "    \n",
    "__Note:__ Often, HPC platforms have a shared file system and that allows users not to define staging directives for the tasks. That is because: (i) tasks will be able to access data saved on the shared file system from all the compute nodes allocated to a pilot; and (ii) users can define the paths to those data directly in each task description, without the need to stage (i.e., copy/link) those data inside each task's sandbox.\n",
    "\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Staging directives\n",
    "\n",
    "### Format\n",
    "\n",
    "The staging directives are specified using a `dict` type with the following form:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "staging_directive = {'source': str, 'target': str, 'action': str, 'flags': int}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Source** - data files (or directory) that need to be staged (see the section [Locations](#Locations));\n",
    "- **Target** - the target path for the staged data (see the section [Locations](#Locations));\n",
    "- **Action** - defines how the provided data should be staged (see the section [Actions](#Actions));\n",
    "- **Flags** - sets the options applied for a corresponding action (see the section [Flags](#Flags))\n",
    "\n",
    "### Locations\n",
    "\n",
    "`Source` and `Target` locations can be given as strings or `radical.utils.Url` instances. Strings containing `://` are converted into URLs, while strings without `://` are considered absolute or relative paths, and are thus interpreted in the context of the client's working directory (see the section [Simplified directive format](#Simplified-directive-format) for examples).\n",
    "\n",
    "Special URL schemas are relative to certain locations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `client://` - client's working directory (`./`);\n",
    "- `endpoint://` - root of the file system on the target platform;\n",
    "- `resource://` - agent sandbox (`radical.pilot.sandbox/`) on the target platform;\n",
    "- `session://` - session sandbox on the target platform (within the agent sandbox);\n",
    "- `pilot://` - pilot sandbox on the target platform (within the session sandbox);\n",
    "- `task://` - task sandbox on the target platform (within the pilot sandbox).\n",
    "\n",
    "All locations are interpreted as directories, not as files. We treat each schema as a namespace (i.e., `schema://` = `schema:///`) and not as a location qualified by a hostname. The `hostname` element of the URL is expected to be empty, and the path is _always_ considered relative to the locations specified above (even though URLs usually don't have a notion of relative paths).\n",
    "\n",
    "`endpoint://` is based on the `filesystem_endpoint` attribute of the platform config (see the tutorial [RADICAL-Pilot Configuration System](configuration.ipynb#User-defined-configuration)) and points to the file system accessible via that URL. Note that the notion of `root` depends on the access protocol and the providing service implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw sandboxes in the [Getting Started](../getting_started.ipynb#Generated-Output) tutorial. Here we expand upon that initial introduction. The hierarchy of the sandboxes is the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "<default_remote_workdir>/radical.pilot.sandbox/<session_sandbox_ID>/<pilot_sandbox_ID>/<task_sandbox_ID>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where `default_remote_workdir` is the attribute of the platform config (see the tutorial [RADICAL-Pilot Configuration System](configuration.ipynb#User-defined-configuration)) and, if it is not provided then the current directory is used (`$PWD`). Sandboxes for session, pilot and task are named with their unique IDs (`uid`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of the expanded locations:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "# assumptions for the examples below\n",
    "#   - client's working directory\n",
    "#        /home/user\n",
    "#   - agent's sandboxes hierarchy\n",
    "#        /tmp/radical.pilot.sandbox/rp.session.0000/pilot.0000/task.0000\n",
    "\n",
    "in : 'client:///tmp/input_data'\n",
    "out: '/home/user/tmp/input_data'\n",
    "\n",
    "in : 'task:///test.txt'\n",
    "out: '/tmp/radical.pilot.sandbox/rp.session.0000/pilot.0000/task.0000/test.txt'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Actions\n",
    "\n",
    "- `radical.pilot.TRANSFER` (__*default*__) - remote file transfer from `source` URL to `target` URL;\n",
    "- `radical.pilot.COPY` - local file copy (i.e., not crossing host boundaries);\n",
    "- `radical.pilot.MOVE` - local file move;\n",
    "- `radical.pilot.LINK` - local file symlink.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using appropriate data actions helps to improve the application runtime. It is known that I/O operations are expensive and can negatively impact the total execution time of an application. Thus, RP applications should be built considering that:\n",
    "* the most expensive I/O operations (`TRANSFER`, `MOVE`, `COPY`) should be applied for staging between the `client://` location and corresponding paths on the target platform, since they will be performed outside of the allocated resources and will be no resources idling (pilot job is not launched at this moment);\n",
    "* task staging between sandboxes should minimize the usage of such actions as `MOVE` and `COPY`, and use the `LINK` action if possible, since these operations will be executed within the allocated resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example from the section [Examples](#Examples), we demonstrate that if all tasks have the same input data, then this data can be located in a shared space (e.g., staged to the `pilot://` location) and be linked into each task's sandbox (e.g., a link per input file within the `task://` location).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Flags\n",
    "\n",
    "Flags are set automatically, but a user also can set them explicitly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `radical.pilot.CREATE_PARENTS` - create the directory hierarchy for targets on the fly;\n",
    "- `radical.pilot.RECURSIVE` - if `source` is a directory, handles it recursively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simplified directive format\n",
    "\n",
    "RP gives some flexibility in the description of staging between the client side and the sandboxes for pilot and task. Thus, if a user provides just names (absolute or relative paths, e.g., names of files or directories), then RP expands them into corresponding directives. \n",
    "- If a string directive is a single path, then after expanding it, the _source_ will be a provided path within the `client://` location, while the _target_ will be a base name from a provided path within the `pilot://` or the `task://` location for [radical.pilot.PilotDescription](../apidoc.rst) or [radical.pilot.TaskDescription](../apidoc.rst) respectively.\n",
    "- Having directional characters `>`, `<` within a string directive defines the direction of the staging between corresponding paths:\n",
    "   - Input staging: `source > target`, the _source_ defines a path within the `client://` location, and the _target_ defines a path within the `pilot://` or the `task://` location for [radical.pilot.PilotDescription](../apidoc.rst) or [radical.pilot.TaskDescription](../apidoc.rst) respectively.\n",
    "   - Output staging: `target < source` (applied for [radical.pilot.TaskDescription](../apidoc.rst) only), the _source_ defines a path within the `task://` location, and the _target_ defines a path within the `client://` location.\n",
