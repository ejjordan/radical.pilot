Usage: $0 <uid>

  uid: UID of the service whose startup completed


This script is expected to be executed by a service instance which was started
by the pilot agent.  The agent will block any further activity until all started
services signal theor readiness.  A service specification may define a timeout
after which the startup is declaired as failed and the agent will abort.

Internally the script will activate the agent's virtualenv and then run a small
embedded Python script which sends a message to the Agent's control channel,
informing it about the service startup.
